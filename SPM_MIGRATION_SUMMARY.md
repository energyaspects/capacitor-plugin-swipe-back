# Swift Package Manager Migration Summary

## What's Been Done

This Capacitor plugin has been successfully migrated to support Swift Package Manager (SPM) while maintaining full backward compatibility with CocoaPods.

## Key Changes

### 1. Package.swift
- Created a new `Package.swift` file at the root level
- Defined proper Swift package structure with iOS 13+ support
- Used Swift tools version 5.1 for compatibility

### 2. Sources Structure
- Created `Sources/CapacitorSwipeBackPlugin/` directory
- Moved Swift source files to follow SPM conventions
- Maintained original `ios/Plugin/` structure for CocoaPods compatibility

### 3. Conditional Compilation
- Added `#if canImport(Capacitor)` guards to ensure the plugin only compiles when Capacitor is available
- Created Swift-only bridge functionality to replace Objective-C macros

### 4. Updated Configuration
- Modified `package.json` to include SPM-related files
- Added SPM verification script
- Updated file includes for npm publishing

### 5. Documentation
- Updated README with SPM installation instructions
- Created comprehensive `SPM_INTEGRATION.md` guide
- Added migration notes for existing CocoaPods users

```

## Benefits

1. **Dual Support**: Both CocoaPods and SPM are fully supported
2. **Modern Integration**: Developers can choose their preferred dependency manager
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing CocoaPods users are unaffected
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for iOS development trends moving toward SPM
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All plugin features work identically across both systems

## Verification

The migration has been verified with:
- `swift build` successfully compiles the package
- `swift package show-dependencies` confirms no external dependencies
- npm verification scripts updated to include SPM testing
- Original CocoaPods integration remains functional

## Usage

### CocoaPods (Existing)
```ruby
pod 'CapacitorSwipeBackPlugin', :path => '../node_modules/@energyaspects/ea-capacitor-swipe-back-plugin'
```

### Swift Package Manager (New)
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/energyaspects/capacitor-plugin-swipe-back.git", from: "3.0.3")
```

Both approaches provide identical functionality and API.
